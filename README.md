With 10,000 available free to play NFT for season one and possibility of further releases on future seasons, players can start small and grow stronger, finally building and managing their own crew by acquiring locations, recruiting hustlers, gangsters and chemists and become the biggest and most powerful Kingpin in London. However, life as a hustler is not easy the feds are watching. Plan your strategy carefully, use everything at your disposal to aid you on the road to the top. Increase your gang size and production by acquiring new gang members and then upgrade them for even higher return but do not spend it all, your crew will require donations and bail money if caught by the feds in order to keep the gang's morale high.
